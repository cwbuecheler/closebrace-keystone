          <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>

          <p>It is CloseBrace, LLC's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. Accordingly, we have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose and otherwise make use of personal information. We have outlined our privacy policy below.</p>

            <li>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.</li>
            <li>We will collect and use personal information solely for fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other ancillary purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.</li>
            <li>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>

          <h3>A Note on Credit Cards</h3>

          <p>
            CloseBrace, LLC <em>does not store</em> credit card data on its servers. In fact, the CloseBrace website never transmits credit card data over an HTTP connection (including HTTPS). Instead, credit card information is tokenized&mdash;converted to an encrypted hash&mdash;on the client side before being transferred to our payment processor, Stripe. Only this token is stored, both by Stripe and by CloseBrace, LLC, and in neither case can it be reverse-engineered.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means that even if your account is maliciously compromised, no credit card data of any sort would be available to the the aggressor.
          </p>
